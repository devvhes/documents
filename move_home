To avoid side effects while working in a graphical, environment we should perform all actions to move HOME from a terminal with Ctrl+Alt+F1.

Temporarily mount the new partition:

sudo mkdir /mnt/tmp
sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/tmp
assuming /sdb1 is the new partition for HOME

Copy HOME to the new location:

sudo rsync -avx /home/ /mnt/tmp
We then may mount the new partition as HOME with

sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /home
to make sure all data are present. Easiest is to delete the old /home at this point (you could do this later but then you will have to boot a live system to see the old home):

sudo umount /home  #unmount the new home first!
rm -rf /home/*  #deletes the old home
Make HOME permanent

We need to know the UUID of the new partition for the fstab entry seen from:

sudo blkid
Note or copy/paste the correct UUID to edit your fstab with

sudo nano /etc/fstab   #or any other editor
and add the following line at the end:

UUID=<noted number from above>    /home    ext4    defaults   0  2
Take care to choose the appropriate filesystem here, e.g. ext3 if ext3 formatted

Reboot

After a reboot, your /home resides on the new drive having plenty of space.

sudo fdisk /dev/sdb > d > n 

sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb

sudo mkdir /mnt/tmp
sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/tmp
