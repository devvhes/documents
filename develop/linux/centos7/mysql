MySQL is a popular database management system used for web and server applications. However, MySQL is no longer in CentOS’s repositories and MariaDB has become the default database system offered. MariaDB is considered a drop-in replacement for MySQL and would be sufficient if you just need a database system in general. See our MariaDB in CentOS 7 guide for installation instructions.

If you nonetheless prefer MySQL, this guide will introduce how to install, configure and manage it on a Linode running CentOS 7.

Large MySQL databases can require a considerable amount of memory. For this reason, we recommend using a high memory Linode for such setups.

This guide is written for a non-root user. Commands that require elevated privileges are prefixed with sudo. If you’re not familiar with the sudo command, you can check our Users and Groups guide.
Before You Begin
Ensure that you have followed the Getting Started and Securing Your Server guides, and the Linode’s hostname is set.

To check your hostname run:

1
2
hostname
hostname -f
The first command should show your short hostname, and the second should show your fully qualified domain name (FQDN).
Update your system:

1
sudo yum update
Install MySQL
MySQL must be installed from the community repository.

Download and add the repository, then update.

1
2
3
wget http://repo.mysql.com/mysql-community-release-el7-5.noarch.rpm
sudo rpm -ivh mysql-community-release-el7-5.noarch.rpm
yum update
Install MySQL as usual and start the service. During installation, you will be asked if you want to accept the results from the .rpm file’s GPG verification. If no error or mismatch occurs, enter y.

1
2
sudo yum install mysql-server
sudo systemctl start mysqld
MySQL will bind to localhost (127.0.0.1) by default. Please reference our MySQL remote access guide for information on connecting to your databases using SSH.

Allowing unrestricted access to MySQL on a public IP not advised but you may change the address it listens on by modifying the bind-address parameter in /etc/my.cnf. If you decide to bind MySQL to your public IP, you should implement firewall rules that only allow connections from specific IP addresses.
Harden MySQL Server
Run the mysql_secure_installation script to address several security concerns in a default MySQL installation.

1
 sudo mysql_secure_installation
You will be given the choice to change the MySQL root password, remove anonymous user accounts, disable root logins outside of localhost, and remove test databases. It is recommended that you answer yes to these options. You can read more about the script in in the MySQL Reference Manual.

Using MySQL
The standard tool for interacting with MySQL is the mysql client which installs with the mysql-server package. The MySQL client is used through a terminal.

Root Login
To log in to MySQL as the root user:

1
mysql -u root -p
When prompted, enter the root password you assigned when the mysql_secure_installation script was run.

You’ll then be presented with a welcome header and the MySQL prompt as shown below:

1
 mysql>
To generate a list of commands for the MySQL prompt, enter \h. You’ll then see:

Create a New MySQL User and Database
In the example below, testdb is the name of the database, testuser is the user, and password is the user’s password.

1
2
3
 create database testdb;
 create user 'testuser'@'localhost' identified by 'password';
 grant all on testdb.* to 'testuser' identified by 'password';
You can shorten this process by creating the user while assigning database permissions:

1
2
 create database testdb;
 grant all on testdb.* to 'testuser' identified by 'password';
Then exit MySQL.

1
exit
Create a Sample Table
Log back in as testuser.

1
mysql -u testuser -p
Create a sample table called customers. This creates a table with a customer ID field of the type INT for integer (auto-incremented for new records, used as the primary key), as well as two fields for storing the customer’s name.

1
2
use testdb;
create table customers (customer_id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, first_name TEXT, last_name TEXT);
Then exit MySQL.

1
exit
Reset the MySQL Root Password
If you forget your root MySQL password, it can be reset.

Stop the current MySQL server instance, then restart it with an option to not ask for a password.

1
2
sudo systemctl stop mysqld
sudo mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables &
Reconnect to the MySQL server with the MySQL root account.

1
mysql -u root
Use the following commands to reset root’s password. Replace password with a strong password.

1
2
3
4
use mysql;
update user SET PASSWORD=PASSWORD("password") WHERE USER='root';
flush privileges;
exit
Then restart MySQL.

1
sudo systemctl start mysqld
Tune MySQL
MySQL Tuner is a Perl script that connects to a running instance of MySQL and provides configuration recommendations based on workload. Ideally, the MySQL instance should have been operating for at least 24 hours before running the tuner. The longer the instance has been running, the better advice MySQL Tuner will give.

Download MySQL Tuner to your home directory.

1
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/major/MySQLTuner-perl/master/mysqltuner.pl
To run it:

1
perl ./mysqltuner.pl
You will be asked for the MySQL root user’s name and password. The output will show two areas of interest: General recommendations and Variables to adjust.
MySQL Tuner is an excellent starting point to optimize a MySQL server but it would be prudent to perform additional research for configurations tailored to the application(s) utilizing MySQL on your Linode.
